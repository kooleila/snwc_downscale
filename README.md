## Test to grid SNWC bias correction to background with 1km resolution
Can be used to test producing obs analysis/snwc bias correction in 1km resolution instead of the original 2.5km. 

## Usage 
```
run biasc_downscale.sh WS # T2m, RH or WG
OR for just observation analysis  
sh run_lsm_gridpp.sh WS # T2m, RH or WG
```
* Heavily relies on data only available at FMI.
